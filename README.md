# Minesweeper-game-in-C-
This C++ code implements a console-based Minesweeper game. It allows players to choose from three difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and dynamically generates a game board with mines randomly placed. Players reveal cells to uncover numbers indicating adjacent mines, aiming to avoid detonating any mines to win.
